        <p>Fate: The Winx Saga has taken Netflix by storm over the last few weeks and is quickly on its way to become the most popular shows of 2021. Fans are left wanting more of Alfea’s magical world and as fans wait for Netflix to officially renew the series for another run, the stars have their own wishes for what they want to see. “I think I'd love to know if I can control water and people's bodies,” said the actress.

            “I’m really interested to see if that's the thing. If we do get to do season two I'm gonna ask [series producer] Brian [Young] about that and see if we can play around with that. Because I think that'd be pretty cool.”
            
            Brian is no stranger to freaky supernatural shows having been a producer on The Vampire Diaries. The end of season one, viewers left Bloom (played by Abigail Cowen), Stella (Hannah Van der Westhuysen), Musa (Elisha Applebaum) Terra (Eliot Salt ) and Aisha as they return to Alfea College to find Rosalind (Lesley Thorp) had taken over as headmistress. 

            The fairies still don’t know that Farah Dowling (Eve Best) is dead but with Stella's mother Queen Luna (Kate Fleetwood) showing support to Rosalind, it's likely they will need to power up their magic to be able to defeat them. 
            
            Although she doesn’t know exactly what is to come in season two, Precious has her theory: “I feel like Rosalind just adds a different dynamic to Alfea.
            
            “I think it'll be so interesting to see how she changes the school and changes the atmosphere of the school and how people respond to that.”Precious also confessed there is something of herself in Aisha: “I definitely have shared similar elements of her character.

            “I think when I was younger, I was quite hard on myself. I probably wasn't as hard on myself as Aisha is. But I was hard on myself.
            
            “I felt like I put pressure on myself to always be overachieving and doing really well. And I think Aisha does that to a point where it's almost to her detriment at times,” said the actress. 
            
            But not everything of Aisha translates to her own character: “She was a joy to play but I think some of the things that she does I just would never, never do. I am not a snitch like Aisha."
